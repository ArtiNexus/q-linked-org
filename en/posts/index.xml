Is the necessary institutional environment, technological soil, and economic demand already mature?
The answer is a resounding yes. The birth of Q-Linked is not a fantasy built in the air but a profound insight into and precise response to the pulse of China&amp;rsquo;s digital economy. We firmly believe that an endeavor dedicated to solving the real problems of the real economy, actively embracing compliance, and promoting the rebuilding of social trust is welcoming an unprecedented historical opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Cornerstones of Trust: A Philosophy of Compliance, Prudence, and Openness in Technology</title><link>https://q-linked.org/en/posts/fourth-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://q-linked.org/en/posts/fourth-post/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After painting a grand vision, articulating a profound philosophy, and designing an intricate mechanism, we must now answer a series of the most serious and practical questions: How will all of this be implemented through solid, reliable, and responsible engineering? Are you capable of achieving it?
This article is our answer. It will clearly display the bridge from Q-Linked&amp;rsquo;s concept to reality, and our philosophy as builders.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;First Principle: Compliance First, Embrace Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;

 &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before discussing any technical details, we must first clarify our position: &lt;strong&gt;We are a Chinese company serving China&amp;rsquo;s real economy, and all our technical architecture and business models are built with compliance with national laws and regulations as the highest premise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Digital Identity: The Social Contract that Carries Trust</title><link>https://q-linked.org/en/posts/third-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://q-linked.org/en/posts/third-post/</guid><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://q-linked.org/en/posts/third-post/Digital-Identity.jpeg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exploring the necessity and philosophical foundation for rebuilding trust, we must answer a core question: what will be the carrier for this weighty, computable trust?
The answer is: a new form of &lt;strong&gt;digital identity&lt;/strong&gt;.
We must redefine &amp;ldquo;digital identity.&amp;rdquo; It should no longer be the disposable &amp;ldquo;accounts&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;avatars&amp;rdquo; we register on various platforms. It must become the sole vessel of our digital persona, a dynamic and unique &lt;strong&gt;social contract&lt;/strong&gt; that records all our actions and carries all our credit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Alchemy of Trust: From Human Covenants to the Bedrock of Digital Civilization</title><link>https://q-linked.org/en/posts/second-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://q-linked.org/en/posts/second-post/</guid><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://q-linked.org/en/posts/second-post/The-Alchemy-of-Trust.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is the lubricant that allows the intricate machinery of human society to operate. It is also its most ancient, most powerful, yet most ambiguous force.
Why can a single promise lead a woman to wait eighteen years for a man far away? Why can trust in one person allow us to place our lives in the hands of a surgeon we&amp;rsquo;ve never met? Why can faith in a cause inspire countless ancestors to sacrifice their lives in pursuit of a distant ideal?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why We Need a Third Way: Rekindling the Embers of Digital Civilization from the Fog of Capital</title><link>https://q-linked.org/en/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://q-linked.org/en/posts/first-post/</guid><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://q-linked.org/en/posts/first-post/the-third-way.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every great migration in human history is accompanied by the reconstruction of order. From the physical to the digital world, we are experiencing a civilizational leap of unprecedented scale. We have discovered this vast new continent and built unparalleled prosperity, yet we have also fallen into a profound &amp;ldquo;Columbus&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma&amp;rdquo;: we possess the technology to connect everything, but we do not know how to establish a truly fair and trustworthy civilization upon this land.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
