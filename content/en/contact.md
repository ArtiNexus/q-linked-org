The Q-Linked protocol is an open, public work dedicated to the future of humanity.
We are building a trust infrastructure designed to serve our entire digital civilization. We are deeply aware that such a monumental undertaking cannot be accomplished by a closed organization alone. It requires the joint participation of builders from diverse fields, different cultures, and with varied wisdom.
We are not looking for "employees." We are searching for "**fellow travelers**."
Whether you are a profound philosopher, a rigorous engineer, an insightful sociologist, or an entrepreneur eager to create value in a fair environment, we sincerely invite you to join this great experiment in the way you do best.

### **A Collision of Ideas**

Our theoretical framework is constantly evolving. We are eager to engage with scholars and thinkers who hold deep insights on topics such as "computational trust," "institutional design," and "digital civilization." Your critiques and wisdom will be the most precious assets on our journey forward.

### **A Co-construction of Code**

Our protocol will be entirely open-source. We believe that for a trust protocol concerning all of humanity, every line of code must withstand the most rigorous public scrutiny. We invite you to join our technical community to co-create this solid digital bedrock.

### **An Experiment in Ecosystems**

If you wish to be a pioneer in your field—be it commerce, education, scientific research, or public welfare—by building a new collaborative model based on "computational trust," we look forward to you becoming one of our first "ecosystem experiment partners."

**Everything we do today is to lay the foundation for a more trustworthy digital future.**
**On this path, we wish to walk alongside all fellow travelers who gaze upon distant horizons.**
