After outlining a grand vision for civilization, a practical question arises: Why should such a disruptive trust infrastructure choose to take root and sprout in the soil of China? Is the necessary institutional environment, technological soil, and economic demand already mature?
The answer is a resounding yes. The birth of Q-Linked is not a fantasy built in the air but a profound insight into and precise response to the pulse of China's digital economy. We firmly believe that an endeavor dedicated to solving the real problems of the real economy, actively embracing compliance, and promoting the rebuilding of social trust is welcoming an unprecedented historical opportunity.

### The Cornerstone of Compliance: National Top-Level Design Points the Way for "Trusted Digitization"

Whether a new thing can go far and steady depends first on whether it resonates with the grand narrative of national development. Q-Linked's core technology and philosophy are highly consistent with China's recent top-level designs in areas such as digital identity, data security, and blockchain applications.

*   **The technical foundation of "reputation sovereignty" has been nationally recognized.**
The core technologies we use to build the trust layer—blockchain and distributed ledger technology—are no longer fringe concepts but key focuses in the construction of national-level standard systems. The "Guidelines for the Construction of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Standard System" issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology clearly state the need to strengthen the "

    construction of a standard system for blockchain and distributed ledger technology" and to focus on application innovation in fields like "digital identity, data preservation, and government data sharing". This provides the most solid policy basis for Q-Linked to build a trusted credential system using distributed technology. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of "

    data sharing" and the "construction of a social credit system," encouraging the use of blockchain to break down data silos, which is the core value of the Q-Linked protocol.

*   **"Digital identity" has become a national-level public service.**
The concept we advocate for—a "unique, non-transferable digital passport"—is perfectly in step with the nation's push for online identity authentication. The "Administrative Measures for the National Online Identity Authentication Public Service," which took effect on July 15, 2025, clarifies the legal validity of "

    **online IDs and certificates"** and their promotion across various sectors. This indicates that a unified, trusted digital identity system has evolved from an industry exploration to the national will. Q-Linked's digital identity system is a concrete practice and deepening of this macro-strategy in the commercial and social spheres. We are committed to becoming a powerful supplement to the national online identity authentication public service and an expander of its application scenarios.

*   **Data security and privacy protection are insurmountable red lines.**
We are deeply aware that the establishment of trust must be premised on the highest standards of data security and privacy protection. We strictly adhere to laws and regulations such as the "Data Security Law" and the "Personal Information Protection Law," and actively adopt national standards and practical guidelines. For example, in data processing, we will draw on international standards like "ISO/IEC 27559:20221 Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection — Privacy-enhancing data de-identification framework" to implement strict data anonymization processes. In application design, we will also refer to documents like the "Cybersecurity Standard Practice Guide—Technical Requirements for Minor Mode in Mobile Internet Applications" to ensure the protection of rights for all user groups, especially minors. We promise that any information collected by Q-Linked will adhere to the "minimum necessary" principle and that users will be clearly informed of the purpose, method, and scope before giving consent, and we will never compel the provision of non-essential personal information.

### The Economic Soil: The Real Economy's "Thirst for Trust" Calls for a New Generation of Solutions

If compliance policies provide Q-Linked with its "birth certificate," then China's vast and resilient real economy offers the most fertile ground for its growth.
Currently, the Chinese economy is in a critical transition period from high-speed growth to high-quality development. Past growth models that relied on traffic acquisition and model innovation have hit a bottleneck. Returning to the essence of business and improving trust efficiency have become the common call of all market participants.

*   **Solving real problems for 90 million strivers** : China has over 90 million individual industrial and commercial households and small and micro enterprises. They are the capillaries of the economy and the lifeblood of the cities. However, the predicament of "good wine needs no bush" being a thing of the past is their common struggle. Under the old paradigm of "traffic bidding" rather than "reputation ranking," the value of honest business operations is difficult to accumulate and transfer. The birth of Q-Linked is precisely to solve this "real problem." The "Dynamic Merchant Credit Score (D-MCS)" and "Business-specific Deed of Credit (BDC)" we provide are designed to let "good business" be seen fairly, allowing reputation to become the merchant's most valuable, portable digital asset.

*   **Promoting the deep integration of digital technology and the real economy** : The national "14th Five-Year Plan" clearly proposes to "promote the deep integration of digital technology and the real economy." The "Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Application of Blockchain Technology and Industrial Development" also encourages the application of blockchain technology in fields such as "

    Data preservation, urban governance, and digital identity** : "data preservation, urban governance, and digital identity" to "enhance the transparency, equality, and precision of public services". Q-Linked is a faithful practitioner of this concept. By providing with easy-to-use digital tools, we transform intangible business reputation into measurable, accumulable, and value-added digital assets. This is not just a technological application but a deep empowerment of the real economy.

### The Right Time, Place, and People

Looking at China today, the top-level design embraces compliant blockchain and digital identity technologies that serve the real economy with unprecedented force. On the economic level, from the government to the market, the demand for rebuilding business trust and reducing social transaction costs is more urgent than ever.
The cause of Q-Linked stands precisely at the historical intersection of technological innovation, national strategy, and market demand. We are not going against the current; we are riding the tide. We firmly believe that in this land that encourages innovation, calls for trust, and is committed to high-quality development, a truly fair, transparent trust ecosystem that can create value for hundreds of millions of strivers will surely welcome its golden age of vigorous growth.
